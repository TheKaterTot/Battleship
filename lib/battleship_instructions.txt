Place your ships on the coordinates by entering the desired locations (for example: C2, C3).
You have two ships: one small ship that requires two adjacent locations, and
one large ship that requires two locations that are either vertically or horizontally
two tiles apart (B1, B3). Ships may not be diagonal, and they may not wrap around the board.
Choose where to fire by selecting enemy coordinates (for example: A1).
Your board will tell you if you hit or missed the enemy ships.
The second player will then fire on your board.
When either you or your opponent's ships are destroyed, the game will report the winner.
